# Software Design Principles (SDP)

Software Development Principles — it is a number of specific rules and recommendations.

Design principles do not provide implementation and not bound to any programming language. They are generic. 

 + Keep it Simple(,) Stupid / Keep it Short & Simple - **KISS**
 + Don't repeat yourself - **DRY**
 + **SOLID**
    - [**S**ingle responsibility principle - **SRP**](SRP/Single%20Responsibility%20Principle.md) - class should do only one task
    - [**O**pen/closed principle - **OCP**](OCP/Open%20Closed%20Principle.md) — class should be extended not modified
    - [**L**iskov substitution principle - **LSP**](LSP/Liskov%20substitution%20principle.md) - derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
    - [**I**nterface segregation principle - **ISP**](ISP/Interface%20segregation%20principle.md) - interfaces should be fine-grained
    - [**D**ependency-inversion principle - **DIP**](DIP/Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle.md) - depend on abstractions, not on concretions
 + Command Query Responsibility Segregation **CQRS**
 + You Aren’t Gonna Need It - **YAGNI**
 + Avoid Premature Optimization
 + Separation of Concerns
 + Encapsulate What Changes
 + Favor Composition over Inheritance
 + Extract when it Grows
